# Title: FinderFM
## Description:
FinderFM is a website developed for a final class project in Fall 2019. I worked with a team of 4 other individuals. I primarily worked on developing the node.JS express server and frontend JavaScript programming to allow for filtering on the Find A Farmers Market page. The rest of the team handled the styling/design, content creation, and website documentation.
